									<h3 class="major">My personal journey</h3>
									<p>I started going to the gym more than 5 years ago, when I was only 18 years old. Soon I realised that this is more than just a hobby to me, it became my biggest passion to become a better version of myslef and stronger. After 1.5 years of lifting I started doing a little bit of Olympic weightlifting, then I found about powerlifting and decided to compete in it. I helped found a powerlifting club in my university - "University of Birmingham, UK". I did 2 powerlifting competitions and got a nationals invitation. At the same time bodybuilding was on my mind too, I decided to skip the powerlifting nationals and give bodybuilding a shot. </p>

									<p>One bodybuilding competition later and I knew that this was the sport for me. I love the dedication, the structure, the commitment this sport teaches every single moment. 13 shows later and now I'm working towards getting my PRO Card. The future is build now and I'm building not only my body, but character too..</p>

									<h3 class="major">Experience and Passion</h3>
