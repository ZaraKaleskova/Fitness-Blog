                Whether your goals are competitive or not, the guiding principles of bodybuilding can help you.  It’s a focus on nutrition, training intensity, and consistency.  I make no illusions, I know that what I ask my clients to do is hard stuff – but if you’re focused and determined, it doesn’t really matter how hard it is.  And with the right coach in your corner it can make all the difference in achieving your contest prep or lifestyle transformation goals.

                What does a coach do?  Planning.  Feedback.  Accountability.  Keeping you sharp and focused.  Being available for questions.  The strategy involved in coaching someone for a bodybuilding competition or a lifestyle transformation is important but there’s so much more involved in the process that other coaches simply don’t sufficiently focus on.  I take the title of “coach” seriously – my job is to teach, to help you achieve your short-term goals but also make you better in the long-term. </p>

                Nutrition coaching will be a macro-based food approach. As we work
                together, we will make adjustments to your calories and macros
                based on body composition, hunger cues, activity levels, and any
                feedback given by you to find your ideal amount of food to live
                your best life. After working with me, you will never diet again,
                have to cut out any food groups, and be a slave to the gym to see
                results. You will learn what food works best to fuel your body and
                find balance in your life, each and every day.
