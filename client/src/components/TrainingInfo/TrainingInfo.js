                  We spend 12-18+ years in school, yet we’re NEVER taught some of
                  the basics. How much to eat, how to exercise appropriately for
                  the body we want, to love ourselves and say positive things when
                  we look in the mirror, the importance of nutrient-dense diet,
                  sleep, proper digestion and a happy gut, blood sugar balance,
                  hormone and menstrual health, and balancing stress. So I’m
                  changing the game and empowering people to find freedom via
                  nutrition, exercise, and a healthy lifestyle.
                  <p>Here is how we will work together: </p>
